        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>EduPlatform began in 2018 with a mission to make quality education accessible to everyone, breaking down barriers through technology. Starting as a small initiative, we offered a handful of courses designed to empower learners with practical skills. By 2019, we partnered with leading universities and industry experts, expanding our catalog to include specialized fields like data science, digital marketing, and web development.

            Our platform quickly gained global recognition, reaching over 100,000 learners across 20 countries by 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted to the growing demand for online learning, launching new courses and features to support learners navigating a rapidly changing world. By 2023, we had empowered over 500,000 learners in 50+ countries, providing tools for personal and professional growth.
            
            As we move forward, EduPlatform remains committed to innovation and inclusivity. With new courses in emerging fields and a global network of learners and educators, we continue to inspire individuals to dream big, learn continuously, and achieve greatness.</p>
